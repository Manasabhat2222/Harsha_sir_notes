kubernetes Architecture 	
	The architecture of k8s differs from master and worker node 

	Master node components 
		1. Api Server / kube-api-server
			- It is the main management point of the cluster and also called 
			  as brain of the cluster.
			- All the components are directly connected to API serve, they 
			  communicate through API server only and no other component will 
			  communicate directly with each other.
			- This is the only component which connects and got access to etcd.
			- All the cluster requests are authenticated and authorised by API server.
			- API server has a watch mechanism for watching the changes in cluster.
			
		2. etcd 
			- ectd is a distributed , consistent key value store used for 
			  storing the complete cluster information/data.
			- ectd contains data such as configuration management of cluster,
              distributed work and basically complete cluster information.			
			
		3. scheduler / kube-scheduler
			- The scheduler always watches for a new pod request and 
			  decides which worker node this pod should be created.
			- Based on the worker node load, affinity and anti-affiny, taint configuration 
			  pod will be scheduled to a particular node.
			  
		Controller manager /control manager / kube-controller 
			- It is a daemon that always runs and embeds core control loops known as controllers. 
			- K8s has some inbuild controllers such as Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Replication controller,
			  node controller, jobs, cronjob, endpoint controller, namespace controller etc.	
			
		Cloud controller manager 
			- These controller help us to connect with the public cloud provider service and this component 
			  is maintained by cloud providers only.

Worker node components 
		kubelet 
			- It is an agent that runs on each and every worker node and it alsways watches the API 
			  server for pod related changes running in its worker node.
			- kubelet always make sure that the assigend pods to its worker node is running.
			- kubelet is the one which communicates with containarisation tool (docker daemon)
              		  through docker API (CRI). 	
			- work of kubelet is to create and run the pods. Always reports the status of the worker node 
			  and each pod to API server. (uses a tool call cAdvisor)
			- Kubelet is the one which runs probes.	
		
		kube service proxy 
			(in k8s service means networking)
			- Service proxy runs on each and every worker node and is responsble for watching API 
			  server for any changes in service configuration (any network related configuration).	
			- Based on the configuration service proxy manages the entire network of worker node.

		Container runtime interface (CRI)
			- This component initialy identifies the container technology and connects it to kubelet.
			
			
		pod
			- pods are the smallest deployable object in kuberntes.
			- pod should contain atleast one container and can have n number of containers.
			- If pod contains more than one container all the container share the same memory assigned to that pod.



Assignment: What happens when a new pod request comes to (control plane / Master node) ? 

Namespaces and cgroups
	- Docker uses linux namespaces to provide isolated workspace for processes called
	  conatainer
	- when a container is created, docker creates a set of namespaces for it and provides 
	  a layer of isolation for container.
	- Each container run in a different namespace 
	
	namespace (To list - lsns)
		cgroups 
			- Linux OS uses cgroups to manage the available hardware resources such as 
			  cpu, RAM, Disk, I/O.
			- we can control tje access and also we can apply the limitations 

			To list - lscgroup	
		pid - namespace for managing processes (process isolation)
		user - namespace for non-root user on linux.
		uts - namespace for unix timesharing system which isolates kernel and version identifiers,
			  time bonding of process.
		ipc - (interprocess communication) namespace for managing the process communication.	  
		mnt - namespace for managing filesystem mounts.
		net - namespace for managing network interfaces.

   React js - FrontEnd (RJS) 
   Vue js - FrontEnd (HTML - CSS - RJS) 


YAML File 	
   - filetype .yaml or .yml 
   - YAML file contains key - value pairs where key is fixed and defined by
     kubernetes and value is user defined.	  

   - Values supports - string, Integer, Boolean, Array, List 

example:

List Representation 
name: Harsha 	
hobbies: ["Coding", "Watching movies"]
 
	    (OR)

name: Harsha 	
hobbies: 
	- Coding
	- Watching movies


employees:
 employee:
            - name: harsha
              fist_name: harsha
	      second_name: Jain	 
            - name: Mohan


k8s yaml syntax example 

apiVersion: v1 
kind: Pod 
metadata: 
   name: my-first-pod
   labels: 
	app: my-nginx	
spec: 
   containers: 
         - name: my-nginx 
           image: nginx:latest
           ports:
            - containerPort: 80   
            - containerPort: 443 

	apiVersion: v1
		- This is the version of api used to create a k8s object.
		- The fields are case-sensitive and YAML use camelcase.
		- The type of api are alpha, beta and stable.
		
	kind: Pod
		- here we specify which object we need to create. 
		- Always object name first letter is capital.
		
	metadata:
	    - This field is used to provide information on the object 
		  which we are creating.
		- Information such as name, labels and annotations. 	
	
	spec:
		- This is used to do the actual configuration of the 
		  object.

		 ports: 
		    - containerPort: 80	


To create / apply a configuration 
	kubectl apply -f <file>.yml	
	
To list objects 
	kubectl get <obeject_type>
		ex: List pods - kubectl get pods 
		    List deployment - kubectl get deployments
			
To delete objects 
	kubectl delete <object_type>


Labels and Selector 

Labels 
 	- Labels is a metadata key-values used which can be applied to any object in k8s.
	- labels are used to identify any object by using selectors.
	- Multiple objects can have same label 
	- Same object can have multiple label 
	- The length of each label value should be less that 63 characters.
		
Selectors
 	- Selectors are used to filter and identify the any labeled objects matching the label key-value and 
	  condition of selector.
	
Equality-based selector 
	- we can use only one label in comparison and it will look for exact match 
	- Operators that can be used  equal_to ( = or == ) and not_equal_to ( != )
	ex: 
		 selector:
    			matchLabels:
     			app: nginx

		       (OR)

		 selector:
    			matchLabels:
     			app=nginx

Set-based selector 
	- We can select / filter objects based on multiple set of values to a label key 
	- Operators that we can use in, notin and exists 
	ex: 
		 selector:
    			matchLabels:
     			app in (nginx, my-nginx, nginx1, nginx2)
			
			app notin (nginx, my-nginx, nginx1, nginx2)	
		 
			app exists (nginx, my-nginx, nginx1, nginx2)	
	
	
Annotations: 
	- These are non-identifying metadata so we can't use Selectors on annotations.
	- This for record purpose only, like we can provide some user information to objects.
	ex: personal_info, phone_number, imageregistry, author 	
		metadata: 
			annotations: 
				author: harsha 
	
ReplicaSet vs Replication Controller 
	- Both ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are always running at 
	  a given point of time.
	- Replication Controller is old way of replicating pods and it is now replaced by ReplicaSet.
	
	The only difference between ReplicaSet & Replication Controller
	   - Replication Controller supports only Equality-based selector.
	   - ReplicaSet controller supports both Equality-based and Set-based selector.	
				
Deployment controller / Deployment / Deployment k8s
	- Deployment is used to create replicas of pod and It makes sure that at a given point 
	  of time that number of replicas of pods is always running by using ReplicaSet controller.
	- If we update the configuration of deployment, it will automatically updates in all the pod replicas.
	- Rollout and Rollback of pod update is possible. We can use different deployment strategy for update,
	  by default it uses RollingUpdate. 
		Other strategies: canary, Recreate, Ramped and Blue-Green 
	- we can pause the deployment whenever we need.
	- Deployment internally got its own autoscaler which is of type horizontal smaller.
	 
	  RollingUpdate	
		MaxSurge 
		  - Specifies the maximum number of pods the Deployment is allowed to create at one time. 
		  - You can specify this as a whole number (e.g. 5), or as a percentage of the total required number of pods 		
		         (e.g. 10%, always rounded up to the next whole number). 
		  - If you do not set MaxSurge, the implicit, default value is 25%.
		
		MaxUnavailable 
		  - specifies the maximum number of pods that are allowed to be unavailable during the rollout. 
		  - Like MaxSurge, you can define it as an absolute number or a percentage. 
	
	To scale up and scale down 
		1. We can update the replicas count in spec / configuration / yaml file.
		2. We can use kubectl cli 
			kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --replicas=10

	To autoscale 
		1. kubectl autoscale deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --min=5 --max=10 --cpu-percent=80

	deployment = pod + ReplicaSet + autoscalling + RollingUpdate 
	
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

DaemonSet 
	- DaemonSet creates that a copy of pod and ensures a copy of pod is always running on all the 
	  worker nodes.
	- If a new node is added or if a node is deleted then DaemonSet will automatically add/delete the pod form 
	  that worker node.


	Usage: 
		- we use DaemonSet to deploy monitoring agents in every worker node. 
		- Log collention agents to grab the logs from worker and all the pods running in it.
 

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

Statefull Applications 
	- User session data is saved at the server side.
	- if server goes down, it is difficult to transfer the session data to other server. 
	- This type of application will not work, if we want to implement autoscaling.
	
Stateless Applications
	- user session-data is never saved at the server side.
	- using a common authentication gateway / client token method to validate the users 
	  once for multiple microservices.	

https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/microservice-authentication-and-authorization-solutions-e0e5e74b248a

StatefullSet

	StatefullSet = Deployment + sticky identity for each and every pod replica

	- Unlike a deployment a StatefullSet maintains a sticky identity for each of the pod.

	(When a user send request StatefullSet will remember the pod which servers the request, If same user send a second request 
	 within session time then StatefullSet will server that request to the same pod.)

Node controller 
  	- Looks for node statuses and responds to API server only when a node is down.

Endpoint controller 
	- Populates the information of endpoints of all the objects.


Assignment: 
	
A. How to use custom images / connect to a registry through k8s 
	1. Login to the docker hub account 
		  docker login 
	2. Create a app to print ip 
			using flask 
	3. 	push the image to your registry 
	4 use the above custom image in k8s spec file.
	
		image: <username>/<regirty_name>:<tag>
		imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent	

namespaces (ns)
	- k8s namespaces is a way of applying abstraction / isolation to support multiple 
	  virtual clusters of k8s objects with in the same physical cluster.
	- Each and every object in k8s must be in a namespac.
	- If we wont specify namespace, objects will be created in default namespace of k8s.
    - namespaces are cluster level.
	- Namespace are only hidden from eachother but not fully isolated because one 
	  service in a namespace can talk to another service in another namespace using 
	  fullname (service/<service_name>) followed by namespace name
	
	usage: we can apply environment based logical separation on cluster. 
		
	Type of deafault NS
	1. default
	   - This NS is used for all the objects which are not belongs to any other namespace.
	   - If we wont specify any namespace while creating an object in k8s then 
         that object will be created in deafult namespace.
			
	2. kube-system 
	   - This namespace is always used for objects created by the k8s system.
	   
	3. kube-public 
	   - The objects in this namespace are available or accessable to all.
       - All the objects in this namespace are made public.

	4. kube-node-lease 
	   - This namespace holds lease objects assosiated with each node.
	   - Node lease allows the kubelet to send heartbeats so that the control palne can 
		 detect node failure.

	To list namespaces 
		kubectl get namespaces 
		kubectl get ns	

	To list object in a namespace 
		kubectl get -n <namespace_name> <object_type>
	
	To list objects in all namespaces
		kubectl get --all-namespaces <object_type>
		kubectl get -A <object_type>

	To create a namespace 
		kubectl create ns <namespace_name>
		
	To create a object in a namespace 
		1. In metadata:
			namespace: <namespace_name>

		2. While apply 	
			kubectl apply -f <spec_file>.yml -n <namespace_name> 

		Note: If we provide namespace in both spec file and while apply, 
		      apply command check and compares the namespace in spec file if they are not same k8s won't 
		      allow us to create the object.			
Service (svc)
	
	- Service is an REST api objects with set of policies for defining the 
	  access to set of pods.
	- Services are the default load balancer in k8s.
	- services are always created and works at cluster level.
	- services are the networking configurations which we do in k8s.
	- k8s prefers to use 30000 - 32767 range of ports to define services.

1. ClusterIP
	- This is the default type of service which exposes the IPs of pod to the other pods 
	  with in the same cluster.
	- ClusterIP cannot be accessed outside cluster.
	- services are the default loadbalancers of k8s.

2. nodePort 
	- A nodeport service is the most primitive way to get the external traffic directed to our services / applications 
	  running inside a pod within the cluster.
	- By default NodePort acts as a load balancer. 
	- Automatically a ClusterIP will be created internally. 
	
		NodePort = ClusterIP + a port mapping to the all the nodes of cluster.
		
	- If we wont specify any port while creating nodeport, k8s will automatically asign a port between the range 30000 - 32767
	- By default nodeport will open the port in all the node in cluster including master node.	

3. headless service 
 	- When we neither need nor want loadbalancig and when we don't want a single IP to a service, we need to use headless service.
	- Headless service returns all the ips of the pods it is selecting.
	- headless service is created by specifying none for clusterIP 
	- headless service is usually used with statefulsets.
	
		headless = ClusterIP - IP (cliusteIP: none) - loadbalancing 
	
	a) headless with in cluster 

		apiVersion: v1 
		kind: Service 
		metadata:
			 name: my-svc 
		spec: 
			clusterIP: None
			selector: 
				app: my-nginx 
			ports: 
				- name: http
				  port: 30080
				  targetPort: 8080
				  
	b) headless with nodeport 			  
		nodePort = headless + port mapping 
		
		apiVersion: v1 
		kind: Service 
		metadata:
			 name: my-svc 
		spec: 
			clusterIP: None
			type: NodePort
			selector: 
				app: my-nginx 
			ports: 
				- name: http
				  nodePort:30082	
				  port: 8080
				  targetPort: 80
		
	Demo: 1. Create a headless service with statefulsets
	      2. Login to any one of pod - kubectl exec -it <pod_name> <command>
	      3. apt update && apt install dnsutils 
	      4. nslookup <service_name>
	
4. Load Balancer
	- It is a type of service which is used to link external load balancer to the cluster.
	- This type of service is used by cloud providers and this service is completely depends on cloud providers. 
	- K8s now provides a better alternative for this service type which is called Ingress.
		

Assignment: 1) Try exec to a pod and Check			
		- pod to pod communication, if the 2 pods are in the same namespace without service object.	
		- pod to pod communication, if the 2 pods are in the different namespace without service object.
            
            2) Difference between NodePort vs ClusterIP vs Headless service with demo 


Service Discovery  (How a microservice will communicate with other microservice)

	1. Services 
		we can use the full qualified name of service to discovery a microservice (pod).
		ex: service/<service_name>

	2. DNS
		- DNS server is added to the cluster in order to watch the k8s service request.
		- API server will create DNS records for each new service.
		- Record A type is used in k8s service discovery and this DNS is created on service
		  and pod objects.
		syntax:
			<object_name>.<namespace_name>.<object_type>.cluster.local
			
	
	3. Default ENV variables 
		- which ever the pod that runs on a node, k8s adds environment variables for 
		  each of them to identify the service running in it.

https://dev.to/narasimha1997/communication-between-microservices-in-a-kubernetes-cluster-1n41


Pod lifecycle 
	1. pending 
		- This is the state of pod when pod will be waiting for k8s cluster to accept it.
		- pod will be downloading the image form registry.
		- pod will be in pending state if scheduler still trying to assign to a node.

	2. Running 
		- The pod got a node assigned and all the containers inside the pod is running.
		- At least one container is running and other in starting state (no container should be in exited)
		
	3. Failed 
		- All the container in pod should not be running and at least one container should be in terminated state 
		  in failure.
	
	4. Succeeded 
		- All the containers in pod have been terminated successfully / gracefully 
	
	5. Unknown 
		- For some other reason the API server can not get the pod state the it will put pod in Unknown state 
		- When k8s can't communicate with the worker node the it will put all the pods of that worker node to unknown.

	6. Terminating
		- when pod is being deleted 
	
	
	Container status 
		Running 
			- When container is running the process without error 
		
		Terminated 
			- Process inside the container has completed the execution successfully or it may be failed 
			  due to error.
		
		Waiting
			- If a container is not running or neither in terminated state.


	Common errors 
		ImagePullBackOff 
			- Docker image registry is not accessible 
			- Image name is incorrect.
		
		RunContainerError 
			- Configmap / secrets are missing 
			- volumes are not available 
		
		CrashLoopBackOff 
			- This error comes when probe check fails.
			- Error in docker image


ConfigMaps and Secrets 
	- Cofigmaps are k8s objects that allows us to separate and attach configuration data from the image content of the pod.
	- We attach environment variables to the pod. 
	- The data is not encrypted by default in configmaps so better to use non-confidential data in configmaps.
	
	Create a configmap
		1. Create a file by name "app.properties"
			environment=test
			database_url="192.168.1.1"
			database_password="adjhfgjladhgalhg"
			
		2. Load the single config file 
			kubectl create configmap <configmap_name> --from-file configs/app.properties

		   Load the multiple config files 	
			kubectl create configmap <configmap_name> --from-file configs/
	
	Create a secret 
		- Data by default encrypted by base64 format and we use it for confidential data 

		1. Get values in base64 format 
			echo -n '<value>' | base64 

		2. Copy the base64 value got from above command and use it in secrets 

			apiVersion: v1
			kind: Secret
			metadata: 
    			    name: my-secret
			type: Opaque    
			data:
   				db_url: cG9zdGdyYXNlLmRlZmF1bHQuc3ZjLmNsdXN0ZXIubG9jYWw=
   				db_username: dGVzdF91c2Vy
   				db_password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= 
		
		3. Types of secrets 
			Opaque					arbitrary user-defined data
			kubernetes.io/service-account-token	ServiceAccount token
			kubernetes.io/dockercfg			serialized ~/.dockercfg file
			kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson		serialized ~/.docker/config.json file
			kubernetes.io/basic-auth			credentials for basic authentication
			kubernetes.io/ssh-auth			credentials for SSH authentication
			kubernetes.io/tls			data for a TLS client or server
		
		4. Using secrets in pod spec

			env: 
       			   - name: DB_URL
         		     valueFrom: 
            		        secretKeyRef: 
               				name: my-secret
               				key: db_url


Persistent Volume (pv)
	- It is a storage space which we reserve as persistent volume.
	- This storage space can be claimed to any pod in the cluster. 
	- These are cluster level object and not bounded to namespace.
	
	we can control the access  (accessModes)
	 - ROX (ReadOnlyMany) 
		Volume can be claimed from multiple worker nodes in read-only mode 
	 - RWX (ReadWriteMany)
		Volume can be claimed from multiple worker nodes in read-write mode 
	 - RWO (ReadWriteOnce)
		- Volume can be claimed from only one worker node in read-write mode. 
		- k8s allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node.
         - RWOP (ReadWriteOncePod)
                - The volume can be mounted as read-write by only a single Pod. 
		- Use ReadWriteOncePod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across whole cluster 
		  can read-write that PVC.

Persistent Volume Claim (pvc)
	- This is the amount of memory needed to claim in any pod based on the access modes.
	- After we create pic, k8s looks for a Persistent Volume which matches the claim same configuration.
	- If Persistent Volume is found with same configuration, it binds the cliam to the pod as volume. 

Assignment: 
	- Dynamic volume provisioning 
	- Storage class 	

Container patterns
init container 
	- init containers are the containers that will run completely before starting 
		  the main app container.
	- This provides a lifecycle at the startup and we can define things for 
      initialization purpose.
    - kubernetes has stopped support of probes in init containers.
    - These are pod level objects.
	- we can use this container to have some deply on the startup of the main container.
	
	
	These are some of the scenarios where you can use this pattern
		- You can use this pattern where your application or main containers need some
		  prerequisites such as installing some software, database setup, permissions on the file
		  system before starting.
		- You can use this pattern where you want to delay the start of the main containers.

	1. login to pod 
				kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/sh 
		2. apt update && apt install -y curl 
		3. curl localhost
			
		To check the log of particular container out of multiple in a pod 
			kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>

sidecar container 
	- These are the containers that will run along with the main app container.
	- we have a app conaitner which is working fine but we want to extend the 
	  functionality without changing the existing code in main container for this 
      purpose we can use sidecar container.
    - we use this container to feed the log data to monitoring tools.	
	
	These are some of the scenarios where you can use this pattern
		- Whenever you want to extend the functionality of the existing single container pod without
		  touching the existing one.
		- Whenever you want to enhance the functionality of the existing single container pod
		  without touching the existing one.
		- You can use this pattern to synchronize the main container code with the git server pull.
		- You can use this pattern for sending log events to the external server.
		- You can use this pattern for network-related tasks.

    #!/bin/sh	 
    count=0
    while true; do 
 	cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log 
	((count++)) 
	echo ------------------ 
	echo $count 
	echo ------------------ 
	sleep 10 
    done

Adaptor container 
	- In this patter we use a sidecar container to feed the log data to a monitoring tool.
	
	https://www.weave.works/blog/kubernetes-patterns-the-adapter-pattern


Probes 
	- Probes are periodic call to some application endpoints within a container.
	- We use probes to track success or failure status of other application.
	- We can configure if there are subsequent failure accrues we mark probe as failed.
	- Subsequent success after a failure also we can define.
	- probes works at container level and init container will not support probes 
	
	Common fields
	   initialSecondsDeplay: After the container started the number of seconds to 
				 wait before starting the probe.
	   periodSeconds: The number of seconds interval taken to execute the probe.
			  (Default 10 seconds and minimum 1 second)
	   timeoutSeconds: The number of seconds after which probe timeouts 
			   (default 1)
	   	
	   failureThreshold: When a probe fails this is the number of subsequent failure time the 
			     probe check the application endpoint.
			     (Default 3 times and minimum 1 time)
	   
	   successThreshold: minimum number of subsequent success for a probe.
			     (Default 1 time and minimum 1 time)
 
	Endpoints: 
		
		http probes (httpGet)
		    host - hostname to connect and check the status 
		    	 - Default hostname is the IP of the pod in which the probe is running 	

			 ex: www.google.com
		    path: exact path to access the application on the http server 
			ex: /mail
		    httpHeaders: 
			 can send custom header messages with the request.		
		    port: Name or number of the port to access the application 
	
		tcp probe (tcpSocket)
		    port: Name or number of the port to access the application

		
		exec probe 
		    command - command to execute and based on command status probe status is defined.
		    
Liveness probe 
	- liveness probe is used to check application inside container is healthy and if not healthy the it 
	   marks container to be restarted by kubelet.
 
Readiness probe 
	- This probe will run at the initial start of the container.
	- This probe allows us to give maximum startup time for application before 
	  running livenessProbe or readinessprobe.
	  
	startupProbe: 
	    httpGet: 
		   path: /healtz
		   port: 8080
		initialDelaySeconds: 3
	    periodSeconds: 3           


RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
	- types of accounts 
	- Type of Roles 
	- Role Binding 
	
	Type of Account 
	   1. USER ACCOUNT: It is the account used for human users to access the k8s cluster. 
		 Assignment 

	   2. SERVICE ACCOUNT: - It is used by other application which need access to cluster.
	   	 	       - Any application running inside or outside the cluster must need a service account 
			         to access the cluster. 	 	 
		Create a ServiceAccount 
		  1a. kubectl create sa <service_account_name>
				(or) 
		  1b. apiVersion: v1
		     kind: ServiceAccount
		     metadata:
		       labels:
		         k8s-app: kubernetes-dashboard
		       name: my-sa		
				

		  2. We need to use a bearer token to authenticate the Service Account.
		     We create token using secret object of type service-account-token.
			apiVersion: v1
			kind: Secret
			metadata:
			  name: my-sa-token
			  annotations:
			     kubernetes.io/service-account.name: my-sa
			type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token		
	

	Roles 
	   Role	
	   - Roles are the set of rules defines to an account to control the access to k8s cluster resources.
	   - Roles are always user defined which indeed need to be attached to accounts.
	   - Roles are always bind to a single namespace and works at namespace level only.
	   
	   ClusterRole 
	     	- ClusterRole is define at cluster level means it a cluster wide role and is a non-namespace object.
		
	    Note: In k8s any object always has to be a namespaced or not in a namespaced, but it can't be both.
					
	     Command fields 
		apiGroups: List of api to control the access 
			ex: 1. apiGroups: ["v1"]
			    2. For all api types apiGroups: [""]
		
		Resources: k8s objects on which we want to define this role 
			   ex: 	["pods", "deployments", ....]
		
		Verbs: The operations/acctions that can be performed 
			  ex: ["list","get","create","delete","update","watch","patch"]	 
			
		Subject: User account, Service account, Groups

	
	Role Binding 
	    - It is used to bind/attach a role to a subject (user account, service account or groups).
	    - Type RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding 
		  - RoleBinding is used to attach Role to account/group 
		  - ClusterRolebinding is used to attach ClusterRole to account/group
	          
		  - We can also use  RoleBinding to attach ClusterRole to Role within a namespace. 	 		

	    RoleBinding 
		apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
		kind: RoleBinding
		metadata:
		  name: my-role-binding
		roleRef:
		  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
		  kind: Role
		  name: my-role
		subjects:
		  - kind: ServiceAccount
		    name: my-sa
 		    namespace: default

	To check the access 
		kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=system:<account_type>:<namespace>:<account_name> -n <namespace>
		
		     ex: kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=system:serviceaccount:default:my-sa -n default
	

How to configure kubectl from outside or from any other machine using service account 

1. Install kubectl on Linux

	STEP1: curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl STEP2: chmod +x ./kubectl
	STEP3: sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

	To verify installation: kubectl version --client

2. Setting Kubernetes Cluster parameters
	kubectl config set-cluster <cluster_name> --server=https://<IPorDNS>:<Port> --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
	
	Note: The above command will create the basic config file $HOME/.kube/config
	      <cluster_name> any name can be given for your reference 
 	      <IPorDNS> should be public one
	      <Port> - 6443 (To get port number - kubectl cluster-info)
	
3. Adding the token of the user to the context

	STEP 1: Copy the secret token of service account from the cluster to connect
		   Kubectl describe secret <secter_name>

	STEP 2: kubectl config set-credentials <user_name> --token=<copied token>
			Note: <user-name> any name can be given for your reference

4. Creating the Serviceaccount as User
	kubectl config set-context <context_name> --cluster=<cluster_name> --user=<user_name>

		Note: <context_name> any name can be given for your reference
		      <cluster_name> same name as from 2.
		      <user_name>    same name as from 3.

5. Switch the Context to your newly created user-context
	kubectl config use-context <context-name>
		Note: <context_name> same name as from 4.
	
	We can have multiple contexts with different cluster service accounts. 
		To list contexts: kubectl config get-contexts

Best tools
1. To easy switch between context - kubectx
	Get all contexts: kubectx
	Switch context: kubectx <context-name>

2. To easy set namespaces default – kubens Get all contexts: kubens
	Switch context: kubens <context-name>


USER ACCOUNT
1.	Create a useraccount 
	sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/<username>/ -m -G sudo <username>

2.	Create a private key for the above user created:
	sudo openssl genrsa -out <username>.key 2048

3.	Create a certificate signing request (CSR). CN is the username and O the group.
	sudo openssl req -new -key <username>.key -out <username>.csr -subj "/CN=<username>/O=sudo"

4.	Sign the CSR with the Kubernetes
	Note: We have to use the CA cert and key which are normally in /etc/kubernetes/pki/
	
	sudo openssl x509 -req -in <username>.csr \
  	-CA /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt \
  	-CAkey /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key \
  	-CAcreateserial \
  	-out <username>.crt -days 500

5.	Create a “.certs” directory where we are going to store the user public and private key.
	sudo mkdir .certs && sudo mv jean.crt jean.key .certs

6.	Now we need to grant all the created files and directories to the user:
	sudo chown -R <username>: /home/<username>/
	sudo vi /etc/sudoers and add <username>   ALL=(ALL:ALL)  ALL	

7.	Change user to <username>
	sudo -u <username> bash

8.	Create kubeconfig for <username>
	kubectl config set-credentials <username> \
 	 --client-certificate=/home/<username>/.certs/<username>.crt \
 	 --client-key=/home/<username>/.certs/<username>.key

9.	Create context for <username> and cluster
	kubectl config set-context <context-name> \
	--cluster=<cluster-name> \
	--user=<username>

10.	Switch the above created context 
	kubectl config use-context <context-name>	

11.	Edit the file $HOME/.kube/config  to Add certificate-authority-data: and server: keys under cluster. 
	apiVersion: v1
	clusters:
	- cluster:
	   certificate-authority-data: {get from /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf}
	   server: {get from /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf}
	  name: kubernetes
	. . . . 
12.	Check the setup by running the command 
 	Kubectl get nodes/pods
	Note: If “Error from server (Forbidden):” then create the required 
 	roles/clusterRoles for the user <username>

Pod assignment (How to create pods in chosen nodes / particular node)

1. Node Selector
	- Node selector is a way of creating / binding pod to a worker node based on the node label 
	- We use node selector to redirect the pod create to a worker node.
	- We can't use any logical expressions in selection. (only one label can be matched)	

	Create a label on worker node 
	      kubectl label node <node_name> <key>=<value>


	Using node selector in pod 
		spec:
     		  nodeSelector:
        	     <key>: <value>
		  containers:
		     ......

2. Node affinity and Anti-affinity 
	
	Node affinity
		- nodeselector with logical comparison on labels is affinity 
		- using this we can spread the pod across worker nodes based on CPU and RAM capacity, Availability zone.
		
		- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution			
			The scheduler for sure it will not schedule worker node to pod unless the rule are met.
		
		- prefferedDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution			
			The scheduler try to find a worker node matching the affinity rules, If match not found scheduler 
	                will create the pod in normal way.

		IgnoredDuringExecution
		      If the node labels / conditions are changed after scheduling of pod still pods continues to run on the worker nodes.
	 
		spec: 
		  containers:
		     ......
		  affinity: 
                     nodeAffininty: 
                        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                            nodeSelectorTerms:
                                   - matchExpressions:
                                     - key: node
                                       operator: In
                                       values:
                                       - worker1
                                       - worker2


	Anti-affinity (Inter-pod affinity)
		spec: 
		  containers:
		     ......
		  affinity: 
                     nodeAffininty: 
                        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                            IfNotPresent:
                                   - matchExpressions:
                                     - key: node
                                       operator: In
                                       values:
                                       - worker1   
	
		
3. Taints and Tolerations 
	- Taints are used to repel the pods from a specific worker node. Only the pods with tolerations are created 
	  on a tainted worker node.
        - 2 Operators can be used Equal and Exists (if we use Exists, no value for comparison required)

	Taints Effects 
	  NoSchedule - Unless a pod with the toleration the scheduler will never schedule the pod.
	  NoExecute - All the pods without toleration will be deleted from worker node.
	  
	To add taint to worker node 
	    kubectl taint node <node_name> <taint_key>=<tain_value>:<taint_effect>
	
	To delete taint to worker node 
	    - (put '-' at the end of the command)	
	       kubectl taint node <node_name> <taint_key>=<tain_value>:<taint_effect>-

	Tolerations 
		tolerations:
                   - key: node
                     operator: Equal
                     value: test
	             effect: NoSchedule

		tolerations:
                   - key: node
                     operator: Exists
	             effect: NoSchedule

pod eviction 
	- Kubernetes evict pods if the node resources are running out such as cpu, RAM and storage.
	- Pod with failed state will be evicted first because they may not running but could still 
	  be using cluster resources and then k8s runs decision making based.
	- K8s internally uses taints with NoExecute effect to evict pods.
  
	  Kubernetes looks at two different reasons to make eviction decision: 
			1. QoS (Quality of Service) class. 
				For every container in the pod:
				  - There must be a memory limit and a memory request.
				  - The memory limit must equal the memory request.
				  - There must be a CPU limit and a CPU request.
				  - The CPU limit must equal the CPU request.

			2. Priority class (Preemption).
				- Preemption is the process of terminating Pods with lower Priority so that Pods with higher Priority can schedule on Nodes.
				- A pod's priority class defines the importance of the pod compared to other 
				  pods running in the cluster.
				- based on the priority low to high pods will be evicted.  

			3. Node pressure 
				node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure: Node has memory pressure.
				node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure: Node has disk pressure.
				node.kubernetes.io/pid-pressure: Node has PID pressure.
				node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable: Node's network is unavailable.
				node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable: Node is unschedulable.
